    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At Elise's Pumpkin Loaf Bakery, we are dedicated to creating 
        delicious and comforting pumpkin loaves that celebrate the 
        warmth of homemade baking. Our values center around quality, 
        community, and sustainability; we prioritize using fresh, 
        locally sourced ingredients to ensure that every loaf is not 
        only tasty but also supports our local farmers. We believe in 
        fostering a welcoming environment where everyone can come together
         to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, share stories, and create 
         lasting memories over a slice of our freshly baked pumpkin loaf.</p>
